## Abstract

This repository contains the source code and experiments for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to financial numerical reasoning tasks. The project explores fine-tuning LLMs using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and optimizing them with Reinforcement Learning techniques (GRPO - Group Relative Policy Optimization) to improve performance on financial domain-specific tasks numerical reasoning.
